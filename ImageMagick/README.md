# APE Tutorial (using [ImageMagic](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) tools)

This is a project used to demonstrate the sysnthesis functionality provided by APE (the Automated Pipeline Explorer).

The use case aims to describe the domain knowledge that has to be provided, comprising [Domain ontology](#domain-ontology) and [Tool annotations](#tool-annotation). In addition it will demonstrate the usefulness of the synthesis approach for solving a workflow discovery problem with [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php), an open-source software suite for displaying, creating, converting and modifying images.

## Installation
In order to run the synthesis APE-&lt;version>.jar needs to be available: https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE. 

## Run APE from the command line
In order to use the APE library from the command line, simply run the `APE-<version>-executable.jar` file using command:


    java -jar APE-<version>-executable.jar [path_to_ape_configuration_file]

#### Note: 
If you want to be able to run the executable shell scipts of the demo examples, [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) tools needs to be installed .

### Examples
The run of the synthesis is explained on the following two examples:
- [Example 1: Creating a postcard](Example1)
- [Example 2: Repacing a color](Example2)
